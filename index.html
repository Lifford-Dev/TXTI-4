    <h1>Txti has retired.</h1>
    <p>
        Txti was created in 2014 with simple and benevolent mission," to play
         a part in a more <br>grobally accessible internet.our slogan
          was "fast web pages for everybody,"and it worked <br>
          Txti served millions of people,with well over half a million fast <br>
          web pages created.since then,the whole world has changed.Now, there <br>
          is less need for web pages that work on flip phones,and more need for tustworthiness and safty <br>
           on the internet.As txti is not able to keep up with this need,it's time for it to step <br>
           aside to ensure we're not causing harm


    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you to everyone who used and loved txti.It was a fun and useful project that <br>
        I simply wasn't able to maintain.There are many lesson learned here,but I'm <br>
        grateful to have been a part of a <a href="https://WWW.omegle.com/">special era</a> <br>
        of the internet's evolution.
    </p>
    <p>peace and love,</p>
